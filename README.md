# Firebase Flutter Snippets

This repository holds code snippets used in Flutter documentation
on [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/docs/).

These snippets are part of our documentation and best read in the context of a documentation page rather than used directly. 

Each snippet has a "region tag" which is defined by `// [START tag]` and `// [END tag]` comments. The code between the tags can be included in our documentation. Keeping the code on GitHub, rather than hard-coded into the HTML of our documentation, allows us to ensure the code is correct and up to date.


## Set up / Running Instructions - WIP
- installed flutter, intellij, intellij plugins
- created firebase project, downloaded firebase CLI, installed flutterfirecli
- `flutter create firestore-snippets && cd firestore-snippets`
- `flutterfire-configure`
